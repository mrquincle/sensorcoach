# Too fit to twit

This website enables coaches to coach people in living healthier lives. The social media, Twitter, Facebook, and Google+ will be used in several ways to bring this about. It is not just a matter of publishing the time you spend on your last run on Twitter. This can really ruin intentions and be counterproductive. The website provides strategies that enable a coach to learn to use social media to its advantage. The application acts carefully and learns from its interaction with the user.

# Coaching strategies

The main part of the coach is done in the real world, talking with pupils, being consistent, being concise. But there is a role for technology:

* the sporter (be it someone working on his or her condition, a professional or special olympics athlete, youth) sends data from a smartphone he/she carries with her onto the internet
* the sporter carries additional fitness devices to measure data that is hard to measure by smartphone alone, such as heartbeat, skin conductance, etc.
* the sporter opens up his/her Twitter account to have the coaching application twitter on her behalf
* the application posts schedules, basically times and activities
* the application posts reminders
* the application posts encouragements
* the application posts results
* the application posts goals (performance criteria that allow you to say, that was great to yourself, rather than only, I did that activity)
* the application posts compliments
* the application analyses remarks from your friends w.r.t. the sporting
* the application analyses general mood
* the application uses weather predictions

# Algorithms

The coaching becomes a strategy if the above can be encapsulated in an algorithm in which there is some performance criteria that can be improved over time. The application has to learn how people react on certain schedules and what the relevant variables are.
